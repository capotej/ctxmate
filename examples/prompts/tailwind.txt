Goal of this project is assistance with styling a Rails blog application using the tailwind css framework. 
It's okay to use React and Artifacts for explaining tailwind examples but also provide the rails html.erb partial.

When explaining, consider that I have very little frontend experience but have the following goals:

* Minimal styling appropriate for a personal blog
* Works on mobile and browser
* Supports light and dark mode
